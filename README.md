# python-logistic-regression

## 📌 Objective
To build a logistic regression model that predicts customer churn using input features from a telecom dataset. The goal was to identify patterns in customer behavior and reduce churn through data-driven insights.

## 🧪 Key Steps
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building using Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook.

## 📈 Outcome
The model demonstrated strong predictive capability, helping identify churn risks and showcasing skills in classification modeling and storytelling through analytics.

## 📁 Files Included
- `python-logistic-regression.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full code implementation.
- `python-logistic-regression-report.pdf` – Project summary report.
